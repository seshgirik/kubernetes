pod runs on nodes which schedule pods with  lable  "ram: sita"

node topology ie node should have label failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone

The pod affinity rule says that the pod can be scheduled onto a node only if that node is in the same zone as at least one already-running pod that has a label with key “ram” and value “sita”. (More precisely, the pod is eligible to run on node N if node N has a label with key failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone and some value V such that there is at least one node in the cluster with key
